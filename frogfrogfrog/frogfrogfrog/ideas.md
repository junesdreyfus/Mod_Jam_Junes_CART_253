# Starting points


-limited number of flies ---->CHECK

-countdown to the remaning number of flies----->CHECK


-GHOST FLY ---------->CHECK

-freezeframe when you hit something ----->Check

-Add a starting state (introduction to fly gobbling, maybe by a fly taunting the player)

-Add an ending state (guilttripping the fly gobbler preferably)

///-uh uhhh healthbars ? Would the fly be able to attack you ?

-cool tunes i think

-gun state (as a collectible ?) (a gun that modifies the interaction, gun collectible passes by like a fly, if the player catches it they can now use it (working similarly to the tongue))

-gun sounds (of course)

-aesthetic overhall

-what do each thing actually taste like. Maybe in the console ? Literal flavor text
